# Text-to-image

This text to image converter android app created images using stable diffusion api.It involves sending textual input to the API and receiving a generated image as output. The API uses machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to generate images based on the input text.

The API processes the input and generates an image . The generated image is then sent back as a response to the request.

The generated image can then be displayed in an Android Studio project by parsing the response from the API and rendering the image using appropriate image rendering libraries. The user interface of the Android Studio project would need to be designed to allow users to input text data and display the generated images.

StableDifusion's Text2Image API provides a flexible and customizable way of generating images from textual input. It supports a wide range of image styles and can generate images of varying complexity. Using the API can save time and resources compared to developing an image generation system from scratch.
